# Griffin Tracing

[Perf](perf.md) is currently the recommended interface for tracing, however Griffin support is 
maintained for legacy purposes. Tracing with Griffin works identically to Perf. Tracer will 
automatically pick the best available interface. See the [Perf tracing](perf.md) documentation 
for more details.
